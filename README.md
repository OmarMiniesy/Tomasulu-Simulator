# Tomasulu-Simulator
The goal of this project is to implement an architectural simulator capable of assessing the  performance of a simplified out-of-order 16-bit RISC processor that uses Tomasuloâ€™s algorithm without speculation.

## Enter the amount of stations and the cycles for each station as input.
## Edit the contents of the `memory.txt` file to place data in the memory.
## Edit the contents of the `register.txt` file to have initial values in the registers.
## Edit the `instructions.txt` file to contain the instructions.
